<p><strong><em>Why We Should Never Pay Down the National Debt</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>In 2012, Neil H. Buchanan, George Washington University Law School, wrote</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.75in;"><strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>&hellip; because the federal government can undertake high-return investments (such as spending on education and infrastructure), the Golden Rule of government budgeting suggests that the federal government should run annual deficits to finance such long-term investments&rdquo; and concludes:</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.75in;"><strong>&ldquo;we should not only ignore calls to balance the budget or to pay down the national debt, but we should engage in a responsible plan to increase the national debt each year. Only by issuing debt to lubricate the financial system, and to support the economy&rsquo;s healthy growth, can we guarantee a prosperous future for current and future citizens of the United States.&rdquo; (</strong><strong>Pg. 697)</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;"><strong>Neil H. Buchanan Argues that the return on our investments is greater than the initial cost, thus ensuring a prosperous future for our children.</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li value="2">Do you think the US should pay down the <strong>national debt</strong>?

	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">

<ol>
	<li value="3">What have you done to help <strong>small businesses</strong> compete against large corporations? If you haven&rsquo;t done anything so far, what would you do?</li>
	<li>Many businesses have shipped jobs overseas.
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
		<li>Are you in favor of bringing them back? How will you do that?</li>
		<li>Are there any incentives for corporations that ship jobs oversees?</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:1.5in;">i.Are there tax breaks? (Can corporations deduct moving expenses when they move overseas?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:1.5in;">ii.What can you tell me about those?</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">

<ol>
	<li value="5">Last year the <strong>government was</strong> <strong>shut down</strong>.

	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
		<li>What are your thoughts about that tactic?</li>
		<li>Under what circumstances would you consider that as a viable option?</li>
		<li>In an interview with Politico on 8/20 Mitch McConnell said he&rsquo;d attach riders on spending bills, and threatened government shutdowns if the president vetoes those bills.</li>
		<li>Is this something you support?</li>
		<li>Do you think that a constructive way for Congress to work?</li>
		<li>Is there a less divisive method to come up with a solution?</li>

<ol>
	<li value="6">Do you think <strong>unemployment</strong> is a problem in Montana?

	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
		<li>Some 24,000 Montanans were without a job this past July. If you had to think out of the box for a solution that might reduce those figures, what would it be?</li>
		<li>Or: If yes, how do you propose to go about fixing it</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:.75in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.75in;">&nbsp;</p>

	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
		<li>&nbsp;Are you in favor of raising the federal minimum wage?</li>

	</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;(if he talks about it killing jobs):</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li value="2">So, theoretically removing the minimum wage all together would induce higher wages? And reduce unemployment? Am I understanding that?</li>
	<li>Has that been documented, or is that an economic theory?</li>
	<li>There are living below the poverty line while working full time. What should be done about that?</li>
	<li>&nbsp;According to the center for poverty research: <em>A full-time minimum wage employee earns $15,080 annually. In 2012, the poverty threshold for a single person was $11,945. For a family of four with two children it was $22,283.</em>
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
		<li>Do you think it is acceptable that employers rely on the government to provide the extra money needed for food and housing (through programs like SNAP) for those employees?</li>

	<li>The Paycheck Fairness Act, closes loopholes in the Equal Pay Act, are you in favor of this?</li>

	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">

	<li>Does voting in support of it hurt women</li>

</ol>

<p style="margin-left:1.5in;">i.What leads you to that theory? (is there data to back that up?)</p>

<h2 id="Rights">Rights</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">Let&rsquo;s talk <strong>second amendment</strong>&hellip;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">1.&nbsp; What are your thoughts on the second amendment</p>

<ol>
	<li value="2">Are you are in favor of expanded background checks. Why or why not?</li>
	<li>Do background checks infringe on rights to own weapons?</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:.7in;">a.How?</p>

<ol>
	<li value="4">Don&rsquo;t they just ensure that those unfit to carry a fire-arm, which can harm others, don&rsquo;t have them. Does affect a majority or minority of gun owners?</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:.75in;">a.How do universal background checks infringe on the rights of people to bear arms? (http://daines.house.gov/press-releases/daines-house-must-stand-firm-against-threats-to-second-amendment/)</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li value="2">Do I not have a right to assume I those with psychological problems aren&rsquo;t carrying weapons?</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:.75in;">c.What about men with history of domestic violence?</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="HobbyLobby">Hobby Lobby</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;"><strong>In June, the Supreme Court handed down a ruling now referred to as &ldquo;The Hobby Lobby Ruling&rdquo;. It states that for profit employers with religious objections can take a pass on providing contraception coverage under the Affordable Health Care act. </strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Do you believe that an individual&#39;s personally held beliefs should allow them to circumvent laws contrary to their beliefs?</li>
	<li>What precedent is the court setting, and do you agree with it?</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:.75in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">From The Atlantic: &ldquo;A group of faith leaders is urging the Obama administration to include a religious exemption in a forthcoming LGBT anti-discrimination action.&rdquo; The letter says: &ldquo;We are asking that an extension of protection for one group not come at the expense of faith communities whose religious identity and beliefs motivate them to serve those in need,&rdquo; the letter says, according to The Atlantic. President Obama did sign an executive order, and it does not include religious exemptions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">3.&nbsp; Should federal contractors be allowed to discriminate in hiring based on their own religious views?</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li>Does that infringe on religious rights?</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">4.&nbsp; If a company is privately held, should the government should interfere with whom they should hire or fire?</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li>Does that infringe on a business owners rights?</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Environment">Climate/Environment</h2>

<ol>
	<li>How do you reconcile the economic impact of coal production, especially in tribal communities, with is contributing role in climate change?
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
		<li>(Coal brings money, yes, but the burning of coal adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and is a major contributor to climate change.)</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.75in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Montana</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li value="2">So, is continuing or increasing natural resource extraction, such as coal or natural gas through fracking, contrary to our right set forth by our state constitution?</li>
	<li>As far as importance: Where would you place a proposal to shift more energy efficient power resources like wind and solar -both of which are abundant in Montana- &nbsp;to cut back our coal generated electricity?</li>
	<li>Should the Federal government help protect our common resources like air and water?</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>He&rsquo;ll probably mention State rights vs. fed rights with environmental question</p>

<ol>
	<li value="5">what happens if states don&rsquo;t choose to protect the environment? That they choose quick profit over long term environmental and human health?</li>
	<li>Considering that our environment is linked via water and air across states, who should monitor it?</li>
	<li>Some would argue that the Federal government is overreaching state governments in regards to environmental regulations. Do you agree with that assessment?</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;">a.Why or why not?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>How are regulations a job killer?</li>
	<li>** <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/does-government-regulation-really-kill-jobs-economists-say-overall-effect-minimal/2011/10/19/gIQALRF5IN_story.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/does-government-regulation-really-kill-jobs-economists-say-overall-effect-minimal/2011/10/19/gIQALRF5IN_story.html</a> **</li>
	<li>The Washington Post reports &ldquo;In 2010, 0.3&nbsp;percent of the people who lost their jobs in layoffs were let go because of &ldquo;government regulations/intervention.&rdquo; By comparison, 25&nbsp;percent were laid off because of a drop in business demand.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>And they reference nonpartisan research done by &ldquo;Resources for the Future&rdquo; in 2008 &ldquo;The researchers concluded that higher spending to comply with environment rules does not cause &ldquo;a significant change&rdquo; in industry employment. When jobs were lost, they were often made up elsewhere in the same industry. For every $1 million companies spent, as many as 1 1/2 net jobs were added to the economy.&rdquo;
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
		<li>How do you respond to that?</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>regulations: What could have prevented the BP oil spill and the West Virginia mining accident last year?</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">In 2013, Montana&rsquo;s 11 million non-resident visitors:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spent $3.62 billion ($440 million alone spent by foreign visitors during their visit last year)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directly supported nearly 34,000 jobs statewide (non-resident spending supports one of every 9 Montana workers)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generated $236 million in state &amp; local taxes (+10% over 2012)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lowered taxes on each Montana household by nearly $550 (+9% over 2012)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">That said, we can assume protecting our lands and environment in Montana are vital to the health of the economy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Agriculture">Agriculture</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>** What policies&nbsp;do you support that are of benefit to agriculture in Montana?</p>

<ol>
	<li>How will you help protect our small farms and ranches in Montana, so that they have both the clean water that their lively hood depends upon, and be able to run their operations without seeking approval from the federal government for every decision they make &ndash; which could cost them time and profit?
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">

</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Natives">Native Americans</h2>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;">According to the US Census Bureau, 6.5% of Montanan&rsquo;s are Native American vs. 1.2% in the rest of the country. Which could mean that it will be up to you to fight for them in DC.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>That said, how do your policies benefit Native Americans?</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Together">Working together/gray area</h2>

<ol>
	<li>How do you plan to represent all of your constituents, even those who did not vote for you?</li>
	<li>Many politicians claim to work for the people, but then vote just on party lines. Will you change your stance on an issue based on feedback from your constituents?</li>
	<li>At what point to you give up your principal for compromise? To end the gridlock?</li>
	<li>Will your work in the Senate increase or decrease partisan politics and gridlock?</li>
	<li>What beliefs do you have that you would say cross over to the &ldquo;other side of the spectrum?&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Congress has an extremely low approval rating, why do you think that is the case?
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
		<li>&nbsp;Do you think you can help fix that? How?</li>
		<li>How will you help fix this disfunction?</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Controversy">Controversy</h2>

<p>You definitely instigate a lot of media attention with your bold statements, both bad and good. I wanted to give you the opportunity to talk about some of the controversial things written about you.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha;">
	<li value="7">I read that you were a member of the Klu Klux Klan. Is that true?</li>
	<li value="7">I&rsquo;ve read that you were once in support of the Right wing militia, wrote about denial of the&nbsp; Holocaust, and that blacks less intelligent than whites.</li>
	<li value="7">What brought about that change?</li>
	<li value="7">There&rsquo;s an internet site called The Respectable Racist with an entry dated April 4<sup>th</sup>, 2012, and lists your name as the author. It&rsquo;s titled: &ldquo;100 Facts about Black People.&rdquo; Did you write that? Are there any facts you&rsquo;d like to share now?</li>
	<li value="7">Did you submit to that site? Did you give them permission to use it?</li>
	<li value="7">If you no longer hold those beliefs, are you okay with them posting that?</li>
	<li>How do you reconcile these&nbsp; beliefs with the fact that a US senator serves his constituents? Will you be able to serve and represent all people?</li>
	<li value="7">How can someone with beliefs of supremacy represent all people, as a politician is supposed to do?</li>
