                    <p style=""><b>As adopted by a Constitutional Convention and ratified by Montanans in 1972, the Montana Constitution provides for certain inalienable rights, including &ldquo;the right to a clean and healthful environment in Montana.&rdquo;<span style="color: purple;">&nbsp;<s>Justice Terry N. Trieweiler, writing for the Montana Supreme Court, concluded that the Montana Constitution protects not only real damages to the environment, but also anticipated pollution. This makes the constitutional protections both anticipatory and preventive. In his opinion he stated, &ldquo;Our constitution does not require that dead fish float on the surface of our state&rsquo;s rivers and streams before its farsighted environmental protections can be invoked.&rdquo;</s></span></b></p>

                <li>So, is continuing or increasing natural resource extraction, such as coal or natural gas through fracking, contrary to our right set forth by our state constitution?</li>
                <li>As far as importance:<span style="color: blue;">&nbsp;</span>Where would you place a proposal to shift more energy efficient power resources like wind and solar -both of which are abundant in Montana- &nbsp;to cut back our coal generated electricity?</li>
                <li>Should the Federal government help protect our common resources like air and water?</li>
