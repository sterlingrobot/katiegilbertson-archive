About this module:
------------------

This is a module for the Xataface Application Framework that adds the
ability for properly privileged users to send email to all records in
the current found set.  It uses heuristics to try to find out which
column contains the email address for each record.

This is particularly useful for tables that store people information. 
It transforms a Xataface application into an instant maillist manager.
