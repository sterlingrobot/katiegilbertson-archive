	/**
	 * @brief A hook that is called just before an email is sent.  This gives you
	 * an opportunity to add or modify data that is being sent.
	 *
	 * <p>It's best not to modify any information in the @c $email or @c $template since
	 * these are loaded once per batch of emails.  Hence if you modify any of the information
	 * in them it will affect all subsequent emails sent in the same batch.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>You may want to modify data in the @c $recipient, which is used to populate
	 * macros in the email body.</p>
	 *
	 * @param Dataface_Record $email The email record that is being sent.  This includes the
	 *  email content prior to the recipient macros being filled in.  This record encapsulates
	 *  a single row from the @c xataface__email_newsletters table.  This value is never @c null.
	 *
	 * @param Dataface_Record $template The template record that was used as a basis for this
	 * email.  If no template was used then this value will be @c null.  You may want to use 
	 * the template as a marker for you to perform custom code that affects the recipient.
	 *
	 * @param Dataface_Record $recipient The recipient record.  This encapsulates a row from the
	 * entity table upon which the found set we are sending email to was formed.  This record is
	 * used to draw values for the embed macros so you can affect the values of the embed macros
	 * by modifying them in this record.
	 *
	 * @returns void
	 *
	 * @see ApplicationDelegate::decorateEmailContext()
	 *
	 * <h3>Example</h3>
	 * <p>This example looks for a particular template, and if the email uses this
	 * template, it resets the recipient's password to 'changeme'.  Presumably
	 * this template draws on the 'password' field to send it to the recipient 
	 * as part of the email.</p>

	 *     if ( $template and $template->val('template_id') == 10 ){
	 *         // template with id=10 is the reset password email.
	 *         // Let's reset the recipient's password and store the new
	 *         // password in a calculated field that we created for this purpose.
	 *         $recipient->setValue('password', 'changeme');
	 *         $recipient->save();
